.TH AUR-SYNC 1 2020-03-14 AURUTILS
.SH Name
aur\-sync \- download and build AUR packages automatically
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.SY "aur sync"
.OP \-AcfgkLostTu
.IR pkgname ...
.YS
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B aur\-sync
downloads and builds AUR packages automatically to a local
repository. Package names serve as arguments.
.PP
Downloaded build files are presented to the user
.I before
execution, with a file manager or pager determined in the following order:
.IP \(bu 4
The value of
.BR AUR_PAGER ", "
if defined;
.IP \(bu 4
.BR vifm "(1), "
if installed. If the exit status of the pager exceeds 0 (for example,
through user intervention),
.B aur\-sync
terminates immediately.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-continue
Do not download package files.
.
.TP
.BI \-\-ignore= PACKAGE
Ignore a package upgrade. Multiple packages can be specified by
separating them with a comma, or by repeating the \fB\-\-ignore\fR option.
.
.TP
.BI \-\-ignore\-file= FILE
Ignore package upgrades listed in
.IR FILE .
Each package name should be specified on a separate line. Comments may
be specified after a number sign. Defaults to
.BR $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/aurutils/sync/ignore .
.
.TP
.BR \-o ", " \-\-nobuild ", " \-\-no\-build
Print target packages and their paths instead of building them.
.
.TP
.BR \-\-nograph ", " \-\-no\-graph
Do not verify the AUR dependency graph with
.BR aur\-graph (1).
.
.TP
.BR \-\-nover ", " \-\-no\-ver
Disable version checking for packages.
.
.TP
.BR \-\-nover\-argv ", " \-\-no\-ver\-argv
Disable version checking for packages specified on the command line or
upgrade candidates from
.BR \-\-upgrades .
Version checks for package dependencies remain enabled.
.
.TP
.BR \-\-noview ", " \-\-no\-view
Do not present build files for inspection.
.
.TP
.BR \-\-noprovides ", " \-\-no\-provides
Do not take virtual dependencies
.RB ( provides )
in pacman sync repository into account. Packages specified on the
command line or available upgrades are taken as target regardless of
this setting.
.
.TP
.BI \-\-provides\-from= DIR1,...
Only take specified (comma-separated) repositories into acount for
virtual dependencies. If the same package is provided in multiple
repositories, ordering is ignored (for example, \-\-provides\-from=a,b
is equivalent to \-\-provides\-from=b,a) and dependencies are
installed according to the order defined in
.BR pacman.conf (5).
.
.TP
.BR \-u ", " \-\-upgrades
Update all obsolete AUR packages in a local repository.
.
.SS Database options
Values for the following options are automatically selected, if a
single local repository is defined in
.BR pacman.conf (5).
See
.BR aur\-repo (1)
for details.
.
.TP
.BI \-d " NAME" "\fR,\fP \-\-database=" NAME
Use the
.I NAME
repository. If this option is not specified,
.B aur\-sync
defaults to the first
.I file://\fR
repository in
.BR pacman.conf (5),
or aborts if multiple are available.
.
.TP
.BI \-\-root= DIR
The location of the repository root. Defaults to the
.I Server
value of the configured repository.
.
.SS Build options
The default build command is
.BR "aur-build \-\-clean \-\-syncdeps" .
Specifying
.BR aur\-build (1)
options such as
.B \-\-chroot
or
.B \-\-force
to
.B aur\-sync
will append these options to the build command.
.
.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-\-chroot
Build packages in a systemd\-nspawn container.
.RB ( "aur build \-c" )
.
.TP
.BR \-f ", " \-\-force
Continue the build process if a package with the same name exists.
.RB ( "aur build \-f" )
.
.TP
.BR \-\-pkgver
Run
.B "makepkg \-od \-\-noprepare"
before the build process.
.RB ( "aur\-build \-\-pkgver" )
.
.TP
.BR \-\-rebuild
Alias for
.BR "\-f \-\-nover\-argv" .
.
.TP
.BR \-\-rebuildtree ", " \-\-rebuild\-tree
Alias for
.BR "\-f \-\-nover" .
.
.TP
.BR \-\-rebuildall ", " \-\-rebuild\-all
As
.BR \-\-rebuild\-tree ,
but append all packages in the repository (see
.BR \-d )
as targets. May be used together with
.B \-o
to repopulate source directories in
.BR $AURDEST .
.
.TP
.BR \-S ", " \-\-sign ", " \-\-gpg-sign
Sign built packages with
.BR gpg (1).
.RB ( "aur build \-S" )
.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B AURDEST
Determines where build files will be cloned. This must be an absolute path.
Defaults to
.IR $XDG_CACHE_HOME/aurutils/sync .
.
.TP
.B AUR_PAGER
The file manager used to view and edit build files. This variable is
split on white space to allow program options, for example:
.IR "AUR_PAGER=less \-K" .
.
.TP
.B AUR_CONFIRM_PAGER
Display an additional prompt after the file manager has exited (see
.BR AUR_PAGER ).
If set, display an additional confirmation prompt after the file
manager has exited successfully. This may be used for (GUI) file
managers not supporting an exit status greater zero to indicate
unreviewed files.
.
.SH NOTES
.SS File inspection
.BR aur\-sync (1)
aborts on build failure, or other errors such as an interrupted file
review process by the user, in particular
.B :cq
in
.BR vifm (1).
See also
.B AUR_CONFIRM_PAGER
for adding a confirmation prompt after the viewer exited successfully.
.PP
To avoid downloading files again, the
.B \-\-continue
option may be used. This may be combined with
.BR aur\-depends (1)
to build dependency trees independently; see GitHub issue #350.
.
.SS Standard input
Targets may be taken from stdin using
.BR xargs (1).
For example:
.PP
.EX
    $ aur vercmp\-devel | xargs aur sync \-\-noconfirm
.EE
.PP
Note that command output interferes with input from the tty. The
.B \-\-noconfirm
option may be used to disable interaction, or output redirected to a
file:
.PP
.EX
    $ aur vercmp\-devel > new.txt
    $ xargs \-a new.txt aur sync
.EE
.
.SS File retrieval
When version checks are enabled (\fB\-\-no\-ver\fR is not specified),
build files are only retrieved if the remote (RPC) version is newer
than the version in a pacman database. Checks assume there are no
mismatches between
.B .SRCINFO
and
.B PKGBUILD
files.
.
.SS lib32
Architecture-specific depends (as introduced with pacman 4.2) are
merged with regular depends in RPC queries.
.B aur\-sync
works around this by stripping the
.I lib32\-
prefix from packages and removing
.I gcc\-multilib
if the i686 architecture is detected.
